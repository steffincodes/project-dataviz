# Project Dataviz

As an Aspiring Data Scientist with 0 story telling sills, I have come across pages that explain how a tool is used to make the chart but not much was available in terms of relating the dataset to the related chart

> ... you are allowed to interpret the above as my inability to `storytell`

Keeping that aside, this `Project DataViz` aims to provide a cheetsheet where given a dataset the recomended charts are displayed, along with the relevant steps to data prep (if any) and how to pass them into various `Python Library` Functions
